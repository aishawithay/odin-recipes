    <u><strong><h2>Description</h2></strong></u>
    <p>Have you ever just craved something so <em>bad</em> that it drives you crazy. Well, That's how I feel about
    chocolate mousse. I used to eat it alot as a kid but since then had forgotten about it. Until oneday, stumbled upon a
    post about it. Since then, the craving started and <strong>never stopped</strong>. I knew I had to make it but....
    <strong><em>HOW!</em></strong>. My mom used to make it for me and when I asked her for the recipe, 
    She said she had forgotten.</p>
    <p>From then onwards, The search for the <strong>BEST CHCOCOLATE MOUSSE</strong> had started. And today <em>(FINALLY)</em>,
    I am confident enough to say that I have officially come up with the <em><strong>Ultimate chocolate mousse recipe.</strong></em> </p>
    <h5>ENJOY!!</h5>
    <u><strong><h2>Ingredients</h2></strong></u>
    <p>The things you will need to make this addicting mousse are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 CUP or 250g Heavy Whipping Cream (Unsweetened)</li>
            <li>1/4 CUP or 50g Sugar</li>
            <li>1 CUP or 200g Semi Sweet Chocolate</li>
            <li>3 Egg Whites</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>chocolate chips <em>(optional)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <u><strong><h2>Steps</h2></strong></u>
        <ol>
            <li>On a double boiler,Add the chocolate and let it melt, string occasionally. Set it aside.
                 <strong>NOTE:</strong>Save the double boiler.</li>
            <li>Whip your cream until soft peaks form. approx. 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Using the double boiler from earlier, Beat the egg Whites while adding your sugar 
                in thirds every 1 minute. Continue to beat the egg until you get stiff peaks. you'll know you're done 
                when you can place it on your head without it falling;)
            </li>
            <li>Add a little of your egg white mixture into the whites and mix well. Now add that mixture into the rest
                of your egg whites and <em>FOLD</em>. <strong>DONOT MIX!</strong> or else you'll deflate all your efforts
            </li>
            <li>Now fold the chocolate and egg white mixture into the whipped cream.</li>
            <li>Spread your mousse on a dish and chill for atleast 2-3 hours. <em>Or freeze for 1 hour ;)</em></li>
