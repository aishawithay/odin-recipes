# odin-recipes
This is my first odin project dated 18/12/2021. 
Here, I will be show casing the skills I have acquired from the last couple of lessons. The project is about creating a recipe website using HTML5. Some of the features I will be using in this project include headings, paragraphs, divisions, lists (both ordered and unordered), links (absolute and relative) as well as links to images.
